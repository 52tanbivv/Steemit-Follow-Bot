# Steemit-Follow-Bot

This is a collection of scripts that interact with the follow functionality offered by Steem blockchain.

deep_follow - follow all accounts that following accounts follow
follow_trending_authors - follow authors from trending tags
follow_back - follow all accounts that follow current account
unfollow - unfollow all accounts

This code goes along with posts:

 - https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@money-dreamer/deep-follow-nodejs-steemjs


 This project repository will include all sub-projects that are primarily aimed at utilizing the Follow functionality that Steem offers.

## Roadmap

  - Clean up the code so the scripts don't have any code duplication.
   - Make a library with common functions
  - Add functionality to filter following by parameters such as SP, VP, Balances, Follower/ing, etc...
